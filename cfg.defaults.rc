[share_sh_path]=''
#
# The path to share.sh, as seen from the stub's perspective.
# This setting is here for documentation only.
# It must be configured in the stub file anyway (see install instructions),
# else the stub fails before this default config can even be loaded.


[repo_name_rgx]='[A-Za-z0-9_-]+'
#
# A regular expression matching acceptable repository directory names.
# It's syntax must be one that the server's bash shell understands.


[branch_grep_rgx]='master|webgit-\S*'
#
# A grep regexp to match branch names that shall be announced.
# Beware that the web audience might be able to discover branches by other
# means. Refer to README.md for security information.
# Please ensure it does not match whitespace at the beginning of lines,
# else things will probably break.


[branch_grep_opt]='--perl-regexp --line-regexp'
#
# Advanced grep options for branch name selection.
# The defaults select perl style als the regexp syntax
# and require that the regexp matches the entire branch name.


[fake_head]='master'
#
# When your audience uses `git clone` without the `--branch=â€¦` option,
# git will ask for the HEAD file to determine what the current branch is,
# and will try to clone that. In order to not disclose your real HEAD
# selection, the value configured here will be resolved to a commit,
# and that commit's SHA-1 will be claimed as HEAD.


[eol]=''
#
# Some servers that don't implement the CGI spec correctly may
# require a 0x0D carriage return character at the end of each header line.
# If you're afflicted by this, set this to `CRLF`.
